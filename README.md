## Judging Criteria and Winner Selection

### Judging Process

- **Stage One:**
    - Pass/fail check for all necessary Submission Requirements:
        - Working, publicly accessible GitHub repository URL
        - Demo/test build accessible publicly or via provided credentials
- **Stage Two:**
    - All valid Submissions are evaluated based on the following equally weighted criteria (“Judging Criteria”):

1. **Business Applicability**
            - Does this solve a real business problem for your industry?
2. **Data Relevance**
            - How have you combined relevant and interesting Databricks datasets and tools?
3. **Creativity**
            - Is this a new and original idea, or has it been done before?
4. **Thoroughness**
            - Is your application easy for the end user to understand? Does it provide relevant and insightful information?
5. **Well-Architected**
            - Can your application/RAG model scale well at a linear cost? Can it accommodate additional features without major rewrites?
- **Winner Determination:**
    - Eligible Teams with the highest overall scores win first, second, or third prize, respectively, based on the Judging Criteria.


### Tie Breaking

- If two or more Submissions are tied, the Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion will be ranked higher.
- If still tied, the next criterion will be compared, and so on.
- If ties persist, the panel of Judges will vote to determine the winner.
